# Linear Regression using Multiple variables

In this notebook I am trying to predict the salary($) of a student that depends on multiple variables

* Experience
* Test Score (out of 10)
* Interview Score (out of 10)

## Formula

salary ($) = m1 * experience + m2 * test_score + m3 * interview_score + b(intercept), *m1, m2, m3* are co-efficients and *b* is an intercept

## Required Data Set

Created myself
> experience_salary.csv

## Future Dataset for detailed prediction modelling

This is created for referrence and the data set is obtained from kaggle
> car_price.csv

## Prediction Data Set

Created the prediction set myself:
> Ist Set

* experience = 2
* test_score(out of 10) = 9
* interview_score(out of 10) = 6

> Second Set

* experience = 12
* test_score(out of 10) = 10
* interview_score(out of 10) = 10

## Result Set

> Ist Set

Salary = 53713.86677126314

> Second Set

Salary ($) = 93747.79628653315
